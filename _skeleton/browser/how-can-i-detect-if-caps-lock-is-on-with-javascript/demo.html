      Oftentimes, especially when creating password inputs, you need to check if
      the Caps Lock key is on and inform the user. You can do that using the
      <a
        href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/getModifierState"
        >KeyboardEvent.getModifierState()</a
      >
      method with a value of `'CapsLock'`. This means that you have to listen
      for a keyboard event on an element in order to check the state of the Caps
      Lock key:
    </div>
    <div>
      As you can see from the above example, the `'keyup'` event is used on our
      element of choice to then call `KeyboardEvent.getModifierState()` and
      determine the state of the `'CapsLock'` key. `'keydown'` and `'keypress'`
      might also work. However, after testing on multiple devices, it seems that
      using `'keyup'` is the preferred method as it works better across
      different OSes and browsers.
