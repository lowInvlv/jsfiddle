      How can I ensure the footer is always at the bottom of the page?
    </h1>
    <div style="margin: 1rem;">
      Preventing the footer from floating up the page is important when trying
      to create a polished website. Pages with
      <strong>short content</strong> can run into this issue, but it's easy to
      fix with a few lines of CSS. Assuming your HTML looks something like the
      snippet below, here are two modern ways to ensure the footer is always at
      the bottom of the page:
    </div>
    <main>Main</main>
    <footer>Footer</footer>

    <script src="script.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
